## Installation

- Make sure you have python installed on your pc. 
- [Python3.7.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3712/) or higher (except [Python3.12.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/), it's shit)

## Usage
- Use `python main.py` or run it manually by double clicking.
- Rename the `dotenv.example` file to `.env` and replace the `DISCORD_TOKEN` value with your Bot token!
- Set up the nuker using the `config.json` file.

## Help
- This does not require proxies.
- It uses asyncio, as to why it's as fast as it is
- The code is really shit, you might run into rate limits, errors.. I did not test this before release!
